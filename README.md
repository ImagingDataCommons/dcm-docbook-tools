# About

This repository is used to maintain development of the scripts to support extraction of
"computable" representation of the DICOM standard.

The initial specific goal is to generate JSON representation of the Composite Information 
Object Definitions (CIODs) and Module Attributes from DocBook XML representation of DICOM Part 3.

# Similar projects

* https://github.com/innolitics/dicom-standard: operates on HTML representation, does not currently 
work on the latest version of the standard, does not generate the concise representation that was needed
for the initial steps of our project. We do not say it cannot be amended to address those issues, it was
just deemed more expedient to start experimenting from scratch, and from DocBook XML.
